        <h3>Rekla Race</h1>
        <p>The sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Ancient Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524â€“460 BC). For a long time the Romans affected to despise this "Greek diversion", but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century AD) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.</p>

        <h3>Aadu Puli</h3>
        <p>fAt the start of the game all the 3 Pulis (tigers) are placed on the apex, and 2 inner places closest to the apex. All aadus (goats) start off the board.

The pieces must be put at the intersect of the board lines and moves follow these lines.

The player controlling the aadus' moves first by placing an aadu onto a free intersection on the board. Then it is the puli's turn. One puli is then moved to an adjacent position along the lines that indicate the valid moves. Moves alternate between players.

A puli captures an aadu by jumping over it to an adjacent free position (as in checkers). Aadus can not move until all 15 have been put on the board.</p>
